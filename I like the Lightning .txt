The Tampa Bay Lightning beat everyone. 
When they don't beat everyone I get upset. 
When I get upset I usually throw things. 
That is a story for another day. 
I don't like penguins. 
They win too much. 
They are stupid. 
Just like my addiction to chicken. 
I do not like when the Lightning lose because then they can not win the Stanley Cup. 
They won the championship back in the good old days of 2004. 
My dogs like watching the games with me. 
Except for when I yell a lot.
